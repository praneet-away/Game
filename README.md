# What are we doing?
Earth is heading towards a catastrophe as we speak. 3,837,130,800 Tons of CO2 has been emitted into the atmosphere, 665,942,142,500 Tons of Ice has melted, Approximately, 29y 40d  are left before Earth runs out of food.

Drawing on the theory of playful successes of using gamification as a motivating and behavioral change tool, we have adopted gamification (which is a combination of game dynamics, behavioral economics, and motivational psychology), an innovative strategy for fostering user-engagement and help solve the above problem. Now, at its core gamification is about engaging people on an emotional level and motivating them to accomplish goals for the greater good.
